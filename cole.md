# Goated Hummus Recipe

## Ingredients

- 1 (15 oz) can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup tahini
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
- 2-3 tablespoons water

## Instructions

1. In a food processor, combine the lemon juice and tahini. Process for about 1 minute, scraping down the sides halfway through.

2. Add the olive oil, minced garlic, cumin, and salt to the tahini mixture. Process for 30 seconds, scraping down the sides as necessary.

3. Add half of the chickpeas to the food processor and process for 1 minute. Scrape down the sides, then add the remaining chickpeas and process until smooth, about 1-2 minutes.

4. If the hummus is too thick, add water, one tablespoon at a time, while the food processor is running until you reach your desired consistency.

5. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed, adding more salt, lemon juice, or cumin if desired.

6. Transfer to a serving bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Optionally, sprinkle with paprika and chopped fresh parsley.
