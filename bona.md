# Gochujang Cookiess

## Ingredients

- ½ cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened
- ½ cup (100g) brown sugar
- ¼ cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 ¼ cups (160g) all-purpose flour
- ½ tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp cinnamon (optional, enhances warmth)
- ½ cup (85g) dark chocolate chunks or chips
- Flaky sea salt (for garnish, optional)

## Instructions

1. In a bowl, beat together butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes).

2. Mix in the egg, gochujang, and vanilla extract until well combined.

3. Next add in white sugar and brown sugar to your butter. Mix to combine. Once well combined, add in your eggs and vanilla. Whisk together. Whisk until you get a light and creamy texture (~1 minute). This is the key to getting a crisp and chewy cookie.

4. Gradually mix the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just combined.

5. Cover and refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes (this enhances flavor and texture).

6. Set to 350°F (175°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

7. Scoop dough (about 2 tbsp per cookie) onto the prepared baking sheet, spacing them 2 inches apart.

8. Cover 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a 3 tablespoon (1.5 oz) ice cream scoop to scoop cookie dough onto baking sheets. Cookies should be 2-3 inches apart.

9. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until edges are golden but centers are still soft.

10. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

11. Sprinkle flaky sea salt on top (optional) for extra flavor.
