# The BEST White Chocolate Matcha Cookies

## Ingredients

- 2 cups + 2 tbsp all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 2 tbsp matcha powder, see note 3
- 1 cup unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup light brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- 1 cup white chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. Brown your butter. Heat your butter over medium heat until it turns a golden yellow color. Pour butter in a heat proof bowl to cool. As the butter cools, it will get darker in color.

2. Combine flour, baking soda, salt, and matcha powder in a medium size mixing bowl. Mix well and set aside.

3. Next add in white sugar and brown sugar to your butter. Mix to combine. Once well combined, add in your eggs and vanilla. Whisk together. Whisk until you get a light and creamy texture (~1 minute). This is the key to getting a crisp and chewy cookie.

4. Once the wet ingredients are well mixed, slowly add in the dry ingredients from step 3. Combine with a spatula until a green dough forms.

5. Add in the white chocolate chips and mix until they are well incorporated.

6. Let the dough rest in the fridge for 1 hour.

7. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.

8. Cover 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. Use a 3 tablespoon (1.5 oz) ice cream scoop to scoop cookie dough onto baking sheets. Cookies should be 2-3 inches apart.

9. Bake for 10-12 minutes.

10. Let cookies cool for 10 minutes before putting them on a cooling rack.

11. Cool cookies for another 15 minutes before serving.

Enjoy!
